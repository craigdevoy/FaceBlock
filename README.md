# FaceBlock â–€
Chrome Extension to stop myself from endless Facebook scrolling... 

It basically injects display:none for the html tag. Lots of JavaScript events firing off which means Facebook endlessly loads. Looking in to fixing that. Basically stops the action of wanting to scroll on Facebook in its tracks.
